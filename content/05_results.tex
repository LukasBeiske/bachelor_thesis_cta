\chapter{Results}
\label{ch:results}
Preprocessing of the first set of simulations (without the scaling of the optical efficiency) as well as the observational data for the Crab Nebula and 
Markarian 421 was done using \texttt{v0.5.1} of \texttt{lstchain}.
The second set of simulations (with the scaling of the optical efficiency) was processed using \texttt{v0.5.2}.
Hereafter the different sets of simulations will be referred to by the respective versions of \texttt{lstchain} they were processed with.

Before training the machine learning models a pre-selection of the events for the simulations as well as the observational data is done to remove 
hard to reconstruct and not properly simulated events. 
This pre-selection can also be done using the \texttt{aict-tools}.
For this work two different sets of criteria are used and the different results are compared in \autoref{ch:results}.
\begin{align*}
    &\underline{\textbf{criteria-set 1:}} & &\underline{\textbf{criteria-set 2:}} \\
    &\texttt{intensity > 300} & &\texttt{intensity > 150} \\
    &\texttt{leakage1\_intensity < 0.2} & &\texttt{leakage1\_intensity < 0.2} \\
    &\texttt{leakage2\_intensity < 0.2} & &\texttt{leakage2\_intensity < 0.2}
\end{align*}
